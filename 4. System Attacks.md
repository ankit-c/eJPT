# System Attacks

## John the Ripper

  ```/etc/passwd```   This file contains information about users of the system.
  
  ```/etc/shadow```   This file contains the actual password hashes.

To crack the password **_John_** needs both username and password hashes in the same file together. Foe this we can use **_unshadow_** utility which comes along with John the Ripper.

```unshadow passwd shadow > crackme```

* Brutforcing using John the Ripper

Syntax to crack password for a specific user.

```john --incremental --users:<users list> <file to crack>```

```
Example: To brute force the password of victim user
john --incremenatl --users:victim crackme

To show the cracked password:
john --show crackme
```

* Dictionary Attack using John the Ripper

```john --wordlist </path to wordlist file> <file to crack>```

```john --wordlist --users=victim1,victim2,... crackme``` This uses default wordlist file.
