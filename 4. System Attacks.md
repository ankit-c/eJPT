# System Attacks

## John the Ripper

```/etc/passwd``` This file contains information about users of the system
```/etc/shadow``` This file contains the actual password hashes

To crack the password **_John_** needs both username and password hashes in the same file together. Foe this we can use **_unshadow_** utility which comes along with John the Ripper.

```unshadow passwd shadow > crackme```

Syntax to crack password for a specific user.

```john -incremental -users:<users list> <file to crack>```

```
Example: To brute force the password of victim user
john -incremenatl -users:victim crackme
```
